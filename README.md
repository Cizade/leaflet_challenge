# USGS Earquake Survey Challenge
This project visualizes earthquake data from the USGS Earthquake API using Leaflet.js and D3.js. The interactive map plots earthquake locations as circle markers, with color representing depth and size indicating magnitude. Users can view detailed earthquake information through popup windows and use a legend to interpret depth levels. The map includes layer controls for toggling earthquake data. This project provides an intuitive way to explore global earthquake activity in real time. The code was written by myself and assistance troubleshooting and editing was provided by ChatGPT.
